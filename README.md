# Creating an ETL engine on TSA claims data

## Objective
This SAS code is from a group project I completed in one of our courses. Our objective was to create an ETL 
engine which is capable of cleaning the messy claims data and derive insights from them which will be judged
by a panel of data scientits from different established companies such as Loblaw and SAS.

## Contents
This repo contains the code and the results in the PDF, as it can be cumbersome to run this SAS code and the 
dataset itself is too large to be uploaded on Git. PPT shows a brief version of insights we could draw from this.

## What is ETL?
ETL is short for extract, transform, load. These three functions help pull data out of one source, cleanse
and transform it and then place it into a sas dataset. Both ETL and reporting go hand in hand as they an
intrinsic part of the Business Intelligence domain. ETL helps to get data in the form needed.
Subsequently, reporting tools are used to access it and present it to the business users.
